DESCRIPTION: My take on a NPC level system designed for Sandbox. Enhance your (FOR GMOD) NPC invasion experiences with every kill as they provide xp. Thus eventually leveling the world and NPC's spawned in it.

HELP:
ⓘ XP Tips: A higher combo (additional kills while the KTC is active) will generate more XP once the KTC has ended.\n Each player's seperate xp is combined into one for the world XP total. '??' LVL enemies count as 2 kills!
ⓘ Timer Tips: Dealing damage and getting kills around a party or alone can increase your active combo time. Getting hurt can lower your time! '??'LVL foes provide extra time when damged or killed!
ⓘ World Level Tips: Each time the world level increases, so could every new NPC's LVL!\n Players start combo time also increases each level. Once reaching world level 6+ the world will prestige and reset to level 1.
ⓘ Prestige Tips: Prestiging also further increases NPC level cap and xp requirements.\n Every prestige level will provide players with one token, allowing for unique skills! (5 skill max.)
ⓘ Party Tips: Player's within the same party name have a chance to boost each other in various ways! 
• You can help start or keep a surrounding member(s) timer alive by dealing dmg!\n Member(s) around each other can also generate XP depending on their last active or inactive combo kills.
• NPC's that aren't in combat with you can also help keep you timer stable by dealing damage to anyone.
ⓘ Difficulty Tips: Each difficulty affects the chances of higher levels to spawn. 
• Each difficulty also effects world XP amount, XP gain, and combo start time (<- when the world gets stronger). 
• In hard difficulty, combo time limit is ignored (no reduction when 60s+), but at the cost of stronger foes!
ⓘ PVP / VS Mode Tips: (VS Mini Panel Mode recommended)
With this mode toggled on aim for the top xp in the server while the world levels up as usual! Killing a player can allow you to steal their inactive kills to start a new timer with, or their current active combo kills!
